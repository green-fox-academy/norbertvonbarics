"In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader becomes obsessed with finding Luke[53] and leads the Imperial attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, but the Rebels escape. While conversing with the Emperor, Vader convinces him that Luke would be valuable to the Empire if he could be turned to the dark side of the Force. Vader hires a group of bounty hunters to follow Luke and his friends, and negotiates with Bespin administrator Lando Calrissian to set a trap for them so that Luke will follow them.[53] After Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO arrive, Vader tortures Han, freezes him in carbonite and gives him to bounty hunter Boba Fett.[53] When Luke arrives, Vader defeats Luke in a lightsaber duel, severing his opponent's hand. Vader then tells Luke that he is his father[53] and asks Luke to help him overthrow the Emperor so they can rule the galaxy together. Horrified, Luke falls through an air shaft and escapes. Vader telepathically tells Luke that it is his destiny to join the dark side."
