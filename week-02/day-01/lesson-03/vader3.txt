"Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever.[5][6] The American Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates.[7] However, other critics consider him a tragic hero, citing his original motivations for the greater good before his fall to the dark side.[8][9]"
